Selfie
============

**Animated selfies of where your day has gone.**

In an attempt to quantify how much time I waste daily, I created a set of scripts to take both a photo of my screen and myself every minute. Then, I animate it to quickly get an idea of how much time I have spent coding, on Facebook, or in meetings throughout the day.
